### Hello!!
I'm a junior software developer working on random projects in her free time.
My projects are in a variety of languages and frameworks, just because I love to learn something new.
To learn new languages and to develop my programming skills, I participate in coding challenges with my friends and classmates.
My dream is to become a data scientist! To get there I'll be studying bio-informatics in Nijmegen.

# Hello!!
I'm a junior software developer from the Netherlands who is working on random projects in her free time.
My projects are in a variety of languages and frameworks, just because I love to learn something new.
To learn new languages and develop my programming skills, I participate in coding challenges with my friends and classmates. </br>
My dream is to become a data scientist! To get there, I'll be studying bio-informatics in Nijmegen.

### My current projects:
I'm currently working on my portfolio (this project) and I'm working on some older Advent of Code challenges.
I also volunteer by working on i18n for a foundation's website.
